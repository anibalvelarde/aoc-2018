## Advent Of Code
This is a repo that contains the source code of the solutions created to code challenges 
exposed during the 2018 [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018) coding challenge. 

All source was worked out using C# (unless otherwise indicated).

### Day 1: Chronal Calibration
[Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/1) / [C# Solution](https://github.com/anibalvelarde/aoc-2018/tree/master/calibrator/calibratorApp)
The interesting things I learned were:
- Difference between List<>, ArrayList and SortedList
- Leveraging lambda expressions
- Analyzing code to increase performance

### Day 2: What is the checksum?
[Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/2) / [C# Solution](https://github.com/anibalvelarde/aoc-2018/tree/master/checksum)
The interesting things I learned:
- Pay attention to detail. I missed a couple of key phrases in the requirements and ended up wasting time. Could've solved the puzzle a lot sooner
- [Unit Tests](https://github.com/anibalvelarde/aoc-2018/tree/master/checksum.tests) helped me a ton. I'll try using those in future solutions
- Need to do more research on C# [HashSet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.hashset-1?view=netframework-4.7.2) types.

### Day 3: Acres of Material!
[Challenge](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/3) / [C# Solution](https://github.com/anibalvelarde/aoc-2018/blob/master/cuttingFabric/Program.cs)
The interesting things I learned:
- How to extract parts of a string with RegEx
- Manipulating 2 dim arrays of a custom object type
- Manging offsets for x & y coordinates
- Paying very close attention to requirements is helping to reduce errors
